## General Installation Setup

You should start from an environment with ROOT, HDF5, and BOOST already installed or setup. These can be installed on linux with apt-get, or on mac with homebrew. On the FNAL servers, you can get these setup by running:
```
source /cvmfs/larsoft.opensciencegrid.org/setup_larsoft.sh
setup root v6_28_12 -q e26:p3915:prof
setup cmake v3_27_4
setup hdf5 v1_12_2b -q e26:prof
setup boost v1_82_0 -q e26:prof
```

While we aim to keep generic to these versions, we confirm that with the above versions PROfit compiles and works on GPVMs.

## Installing through CMAKE

```
mkdir PROfit
cd PROfit
git clone https://github.com/markrosslonergan/Elephant_Vanishes.git
cd Elephant_Vanishes/build
cmake ..
make -j 64
```

You can the add the PROfit executables to your path if you so wish
export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/bin

### Installed dependancies
In order to insure compatability, some smaller depedancies will be installed by the CMAKE scripts. These include
/*:
  * Eigen, 3.4.0 https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git
  * TinyXML2, 9.0.0 https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2.git
  * lbfgspp, our own fork of v0.3.0 https://github.com/yixuan/LBFGSpp.git
  */


## Installing through Python Interface

With global ROOT, hdf5 and boost avialble, setup a python environment:
```
python -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
```
Install the build dependencies for profit:
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install wheel setuptools pybind11 numpy==2.0.2
```
Install profit:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/gputnam/Elephant_Vanishes
```

Then you're done! You can now ``import profit`` in a python shell, run the python executables (``PROsurf.py``, e.g.), or run the PRO* binary executables with the ``PRO`` helper (``PRO PROsurf``, e.g.).

### Installing for Development through Python Interface

If you want to develop PROfit, then it is useful to clone down a local copy of the repository and then install it. Start with the same steps to initialize your python virtual environment:
```
python -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install wheel setuptools pybind11 numpy===2.0.2
```

Then pull down the profit repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/gputnam/Elephant_Vanishes.git
```
Then enter the repsoitory and install it:
```
cd Elephant_Vanishes
pip install .
```
If you make some changes, you can update the installation by re-running ``pip install .``


### Basic Description of main classes and use cases

- **PROlog** : Fairly simple logging/verbosity wrapper class. This is the only way PROfit should print. Usage as:
    -       log<LOG_DEBUG>(L"%1% || Using a total of %2% individual files") % __func__  % num_files;
    - LOG ERROR = 1
    - LOG WARNING = 2
    - LOG INFO = 3 :  This should be level of standard physics output that someone would plausibly use, but not create giant log files!
    - LOG DEBUG = 4 
- **PROconfig** : Primary bookkeeping and XML loading class. Stores ALL information of mode-detector-channel-subchannel information. Must be created once and only once per PROfit executable and passed by reference to more complex functions when it is needed.
    - Contains helper functions channel<-> subchannel mapping..etc..
    - As well as functions for how to collapse subchannels to channels
- **PROspec**  : Class for storing final spectra and errors. Barebones class as all binning,collapsing handeld by PRoconfig/
    - Essentially two Eigen::VectorXD ! Simple with helper functions
- **PROpeller** : The PROpeller, which moves the analysis forward. A class to keep all MC events for oscllation event-by-event.
    - Saved as a set of six std::vector floats or ints. 
    - Currently only truth (energy), reco (energy) baseline, pdg, addedweight and precalculated bin incicies indicating where the reco variable fits in a given PROconfig defined binning. 
- **PROtocall** : Currently a bit of a rogue set of functions that, given a PROconfig, dictate how to get binning and collapse Covariance matricies
- **PROcess** : The master weighting function that combines everything to give one final output spectra (PROspec) event-by-event. 
    - FillRecoSpectra (PROconfig,PROpeller,PROsyst,PROosc, shifts, phys param)
- **PROcreate** : Workhorse classes for loading the set of root ntuples and systematics into PROspec CV class and a vector of SystStructs for systematics.  
    - Needs a PROconfig to tell it exactly what to load and where (channel and subchannel info) to assign the variables. Also which systeatics to load.
    - The class **SystStruct** is also defined in here (for some reason), which stores the weights and spline information for systematics
- **PROsyst** : Class that groups all systematics (each with a SystStruct) and manages their formation and effect on PROspecs
    - i.e generates covariance matricies, fills splines, gets spline shifted spectrum.. etc..
    - Currently has Spline (CAFana style), Covariance (SBNfit style) and MFA (2D spline to-be-implemented) options
- **PROsc** : The model class (not the lack of second 'o'). Currently is a very simple hardcoded 3+1 SBL approximation.
    -- End goal to implement custom classes, NuSquids..etc..
- **PROchi** : Class that gathers the MC (PROpeller), Systematics (PROsyst) and model (PROsc) and forms a function calculating a chi^2 that can be minimized over
